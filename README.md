# English--French-translator-by-using-RNN

# Machine Learning Using Tensorflow (RNN) to implement language translator for English-French translation. Translating English sentences to French, using LSTM on RNN architecture. Accuracy of model : 95%

# We will go through 6 tasks to implement our project:

## TASK 1: IMPORT LIBRARIES AND DATASETS 

## TASK 2: PERFORM DATA CLEANING

## TASK 3: VISUALIZE CLEANED UP DATASET

## TASK 4: PREPARE THE DATA BY PERFORMING TOKENIZATION AND PADDING

## TASK 5: build the RNN model  

## TASK 6: ASSESS TRAINED MODEL PERFORMANCE
